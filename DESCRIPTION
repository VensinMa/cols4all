Description: Color palettes for all people, including those with color vision deficiency. Palettes, organized by source and type, are scored on several properties such as color-blind-friendliness and harmony. Furthermore each palette is assigned a distinct color for missing values. Own palettes can be loaded as well. ggplot2 scales are included.
